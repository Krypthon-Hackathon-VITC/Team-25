What is machine learning? In this video, we will try to define what it is, and also try to give you a sense of when you want to use machine learning.
Even among machine learning practitioners, there isn't a well-accepted definition of what is and what isn't machine learning.
But let me show you a couple of examples of the ways that people have tried to define it.
Here's the definition of what is machine learning that is due to Arthur Samuel.
He defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950s, he wrote a checkers playing program.
And the amazing thing about this checkers playing program was that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player.
But what he did was he had the program play tens of thousands of games against itself.
And by watching what sort of board positions tended to lead to wins, and what sort of board positions tended to lead to losses,
the checkers playing program learned over time what are good board positions and what are bad board positions.
