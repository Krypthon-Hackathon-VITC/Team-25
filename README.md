# Enhanced Virtual Learning using AI
## Problem Statement
Today's online education is predominantly published in English, which creates a language barrier for students with vernacular background. This limits their ability to access online resources and acquire new skills. The language gap here, highlights the need for more resources and tools to facilitate learning in vernacular languages, thus promoting inclusivity and expanding access to education.Education in vernacular languages is essential for promoting inclusivity and ensuring access to education for all. It enables students to understand and engage with the content better, leading to improved academic outcomes. 

Our idea aims to address the vernacular gap that exists in current education and overcome it with the integration of modern day technology using Artificial Intelligence, to enhance virtual learning. Translations can also help preserve cultural heritage by promoting the use of local languages and promote greater inclusion and participation for individuals with language disorders.
